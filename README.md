About

  Textify is a hobbyist project taken up initially to understand the power of the python imaging library. It 
takes in text input and an image and generates an output image formed using the input text to produce a combination 
of both visual and textual information 


How does it work ?
 download the source code and run textify.py
 
    python textify.py input_image.jpg input_text.txt

Saves an output image "output.jpg" which contains the combination of input_image.jpg and input_text.txt and saves it 
in the working directory

Takes 43 microseconds to modify each pixel
